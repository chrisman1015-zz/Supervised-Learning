Here you can find my unsupervised learning tutorials. Be aware these are Ipython files created using Jupyter Notebook, 
and some of the functionality may be lost when not opened in Jupyter Notebook or Lab.

  -I have a few more projects on the way, but the more complex models take a bit longer to create. Check back soon!
